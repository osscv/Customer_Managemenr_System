# Guide: Setting Up and Changing MySQL Password in `config.php`

To set up and change the MySQL password for the **Customer Management System**, follow these steps:

---

### 1. **Clone the Repository**

Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/osscv/Customer_Managemenr_System.zip
```

### 2. **Upload to Your Server**

Upload the files to your server or hosting provider. For example, if you are using a BT Panel or a similar web hosting panel, you can upload the files to the desired directory (e.g., `/www/wwwroot/calling-system.dkly.top/v3/`).

### 3. **Unzip the Files**

After uploading the repository, navigate to the directory where you uploaded the files. Unzip the files if necessary. You can do this via your hosting panel or via SSH (e.g., using the `unzip` command):

```bash
unzip Customer_Managemenr_System.zip
```
This will extract the contents into the directory so that the system is ready to use.

### 4. **Update the `config.php` File**

In your `config.php` file, change the password in the `$password` variable to your new MySQL password. Here's an updated version of the `config.php` file:

```php
<?php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "callingsys";
// Change this to your new MySQL password
$password = "NEW_PASSWORD_HERE";
$dbname = "callingsys";
 
// Create connection
$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);
 
// Check connection
if ($conn->connect_error) {
    die("Connection failed: " . $conn->connect_error);
}
?>
```

Replace `NEW_PASSWORD_HERE` with your new password.

---

### 5. **Change MySQL Password**

To change the MySQL password for the `callingsys` user, follow these steps:

#### a. Log into MySQL

Open your terminal and run the following command to log into MySQL (replace `root` with your MySQL admin user if it's different):

```bash
mysql -u root -p
```

Enter your MySQL root password when prompted.

#### b. Change the Password

Once you're logged in, run the following SQL command to change the password for the `callingsys` user:

```sql
ALTER USER 'callingsys'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'NEW_PASSWORD_HERE';
```

Replace `NEW_PASSWORD_HERE` with the new password you want to set.

#### c. Flush Privileges

To ensure the changes take effect, run the following command:

```sql
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

#### d. Exit MySQL

After the password is changed, exit MySQL by running:

```sql
EXIT;
```

---

### 6. **Test the Connection**

Once you've updated the password in both MySQL and `config.php`, test your connection to ensure everything is working correctly. If there are any issues, double-check the credentials in the `config.php` file and verify that the new password is correct.
